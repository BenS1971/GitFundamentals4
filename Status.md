# git status

The command `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, tatus of your repository.

Using `git status` will will show you what changes are being tracked, aren't being tracked, what commits need to be pushed/pulled, etc. It is basically a status check.

This command is safe to use any time. If you want to see what is going on, it's good to use `git status` in between commands until you get the know the flow better.

```
git add .
git status

git commit -m "Modified Landing Page"
git status

git push
git status
```
